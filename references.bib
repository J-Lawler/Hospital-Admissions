	abstract = {Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting presents three statistical frameworks for modern demographic estimation and forecasting. The frameworks draw on recent advances in statistical methodology to provide new tools for tackling challenges such as disaggregation, measurement error, missing data, and combining multiple data sources. The methods apply to single demographic series, or to entire demographic systems. The methods unify estimation and forecasting, and yield detailed measures of uncertainty.The book assumes minimal knowledge of statistics, and no previous knowledge of demography. The authors have developed a set of R packages implementing the methods. Data and code for all applications in the book are available on www.bdef-book.com."This book will be welcome for the scientific community of forecasters…as it presents a new approach which has already given important results and which, in my opinion, will increase its importance in the future." {\textasciitilde}Daniel Courgeau, Institut national d'études démographiques},

	isbn = {978-981-19475-4-4},
	abstract = {This book provides a highly practical introduction to Bayesian statistical modeling with Stan, which has become the most popular probabilistic programming language.The book is divided into four parts. The first part reviews the theoretical background of modeling and Bayesian inference and presents a modeling workflow that makes modeling more engineering than art. The second part discusses the use of Stan, CmdStanR, and CmdStanPy from the very beginning to basic regression analyses. The third part then introduces a number of probability distributions, nonlinear models, and hierarchical (multilevel) models, which are essential to mastering statistical modeling. It also describes a wide range of frequently used modeling techniques, such as censoring, outliers, missing data, speed-up, and parameter constraints, and discusses how to lead convergence of MCMC. Lastly, the fourth part examines advanced topics for real-world data: longitudinal data analysis, state space models, spatial data analysis, Gaussian processes, Bayesian optimization, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and information criteria, demonstrating that Stan can solve any one of these problems in as little as 30 lines.Using numerous easy-to-understand examples, the book explains key concepts, which continue to be useful when using future versions of Stan and when using other statistical modeling tools. The examples do not require domain knowledge and can be generalized to many fields. The book presents full explanations of code and math formulas, enabling readers to extend models for their own problems. All the code and data are on GitHub.},

	abstract = {US inpatient capacity increased until the 1970s, then declined. The US Census Bureau expects the population aged ≥65 years to more than double by 2050. The implications for national inpatient capacity requirements have not been quantified. Our objective was to calculate the number of hospital admissions that will be necessitated by population aging, ceteris paribus. We estimated 2011 nationwide age-specific hospitalization rates using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Census data. We applied these rates to the population expected by the Census Bureau to exist through 2050. By 2050, the US population is expected to increase by 41\%. Our analysis suggests that based on expected changes in the population age structure by then, the annual number of hospitalizations will increase by 67\%. Thus, inpatient capacity would have to expand 18\% more than population growth to meet demand. Total aggregate inpatient days is projected to increase 22\% more than population growth. The total projected growth in required inpatient capacity is 72\%, accounting for both number of admissions and length of stay. This analysis accounts only for changes in the population's age structure. Other factors could increase or decrease demand, as discussed in the article.

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, increasing volumes of provincially financed health care services have boosted the share of provincial health care spending in GDP by an average of 1.1 percentage points nationally. Slower economic growth in the future would mean that the shares of provincial GDPs absorbed by health care spending would rise faster. Figure 5 sketches the results of the projections. By 2020, the national figure rises by 1.3 percentage points to 7.4 percent of GDP. In several provinces -- such as Newfoundland and New Brunswick -- and Yukon Territory, the increase in the share of GDP absorbed by health care is 2.4 percentage points or more, dwarfing the increase since 1980. By 2040, the share of national GDP absorbed by provincial health care spending rises by almost two-thirds, with even the least-affected provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan seeing increases of more than one-third,(13) and the share for the most affected doubling.
Projections using those circumstances yield provincial health care budgets that reach 8.5 percent of GDP by 2020 and 11.5 percent by 2040. With provincial own-source revenues constant as shares of GDP, health care spending absorbs almost half of them by 2020 and just less than two-thirds by 2040. The national implicit health care liability is \$835 billion, with provincial figures ranging from one-half to three-quarters of current GDP in Ontario and the Prairies to amounts roughly equal to current GDP in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and British Columbia and about 130 percent of current GDP in Newfoundland and the territories.
Under either scenario, the seniors health grant would shift a little more than one-third of the implicit health care liability -- some \$185 to \$190 billion, equal to 18 percent of national GDP -- from the provincial governments to Ottawa.(28) And under either scenario, the provinces with the most rapidly aging populations would, by design, receive the greatest benefit. In the base-case projection, the seniors health grant would provide additional amounts equal to 2 to 3 percentage points of provincial GDP and 12 to 17 percentage points of own-source revenues in the Atlantic provinces by 2040, reducing their implicit health care liabilities by some 25 to 30 percentage points of GDP. Quebec, British Columbia, and Yukon would also gain relatively more from the grant. In the alternative scenario, where interprovincial migration continues at levels typical of the 1990s, the seniors health grant would be relatively more important in sustaining health care in provinces subject to substantial out-migration. Newfoundland and Yukon would reap by far the largest benefits,(29) while Manitoba and Saskatchewan would gain some protection.},

	abstract = {Objective. To assess the coming challenges of caring for large numbers of frail elderly as the Baby Boom generation ages. Study Setting. A review of economic and demographic data as well as simulations of projected socioeconomic and demographic patterns in the year 2030 form the basis of a review of the challenges related to caring for seniors that need to be faced by society. Study Design. A series of analyses are used to consider the challenges related to caring for elders in the year 2030: (1) measures of macroeconomic burden are developed and analyzed, (2) the literatures on trends in disability, payment approaches for long-term care, healthy aging, and cultural views of aging are analyzed and synthesized, and(3)simulations of future income and assets patterns of the Baby Boom generation are developed. Principal Findings. The economic burden of aging in 2030 should be no greater than the economic burden associated with raising large numbers of baby boom children in the 1960s. The real challenges of caring for the elderly in 2030 will involve: (1) making sure society develops payment and insurance systems for long-term care that work better than existing ones, (2) taking advantage of advances in medicine and behavioral health to keep the elderly as healthy and active as possible, (3) changing the way society organizes community services so that care is more accessible, and (4) altering the cultural view of aging to make sure all ages are integrated into the fabric of community life. Conclusions. To meet the long-term care needs of Baby Boomers, social and public policy changes must begin soon. Meeting the financial and social service burdens of growing numbers of elders will not be a daunting task if necessary changes are made now rather than when Baby Boomers actually need long-term care.},

Debates in the United States, in particular, highlight concerns about intergenerational equity, whereby spending on older people is perceived as a threat to spending on the young. This paper compares how the problem of health spending is defined in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States by presenting the results of a content analysis of print media during the period 2005–2010. We found that population ageing was cited as an important source of health care cost increases in all three countries but was cited less frequently in Canadian newspapers than in the UK or US papers. Direct claims about intergenerational equity are infrequent among the articles we coded, but newspaper articles in the United States were more likely than those in Canada and the United Kingdom to claim that of high health care spending on older people takes resources away from younger people. In Canada a much larger percentage of articles in our sample either claimed that high health care spending is crowding out other types of government expenditure. Finally, we found that almost no articles in the United States challenged the view that population ageing causes health care spending, whereas in both Canada and the United Kingdom a small, but steady stream of articles challenged the idea that population ageing is to blame for health care spending increases.},

This new-found longevity is testament to the success of recent advances in medicine, but poses significant challenges to multiple areas of health care concerning older patients. Building upon its predecessor's reputation as the definitive resource on the subject, this new edition of the Oxford Textbook of Geriatric Medicine offers a comprehensive and multinational examination of the field. Fully revised to reflect the current state of geriatric medicine, it examines the medical and scientific basis of clinical issues, as well as the ethical, legal, and socio-economic concerns for healthcare policy and systems. Over 170 chapters are broken up into 16 key sections, covering topics ranging from policy and key concepts through to infection, cancer, palliative medicine, and healthy ageing. New material includes focus on the evolving concepts of malnutrition, sarcopenia, frailty, and related geriatric syndromes and integration of geriatric principles from public health, primary and specialized care, and transitional stages from home to emergency, medicine and surgery, rehabilitation, and long term care. The Oxford Textbook of Geriatric Medicine brings together specialists from across the globe to provide every physician involved in the care of older patients with a comprehensive resource on all the clinical problems they are likely to encounter, as well as on related psychological, philosophical, and social issues.},

	abstract = {Policy context: - All countries in Europe are experiencing an ageing of their populations, with a decrease in the number of people of working age per retiree. - Health trends among the elderly are mixed: severe disability is declining in some countries but increasing in others, while mild disability and chronic disease are generally increasing. - A declining working-age population will generate less income for health and pension systems. While expenditure on long-term care is certain to increase with the ageing of the population, the effects on health care expenditure are disputed. It is clear that if appropriate measures are implemented in time, population ageing does not inevitably lead to significantly higher health care expenditure. Policy options: Ensuring an adequate response from health systems. - A better coordination of care across health and social services, as well as across different levels of health care is seen as crucial. - As many older people remain in hospital inappropriately, a number of measures can be applied to allow for more treatments out of hospital. - Measures that reduce the risk of disease and promote the maintenance of function, confidence and engagement can support healthy ageing and ease the pressure on health care systems. Most notable are health promotion and disease prevention programmes that target the main causes of morbidity and premature mortality, in particular obesity and hypertension, as well as mental health. - These measures should include physical exercise and social involvement. The period from middle age onwards is particularly important for these activities and interventions. Building adequate systems of long-term care. Ensuring an appropriate combination of settings for long-term care that includes both formal and informal care is regarded as crucial. Supporting economic and social integration. - The decline in the share of the population of working age that will have to finance the health system can be addressed by measures that enable more older people to remain in the labour force. - Policies in support of healthy ageing also need to address the need for the continued social engagement of elderly people.},

	abstract = {Introduction Population ageing is a welcome testament to improvements in the social, economic and health circumstances over the life course. However, these successes necessitate that we understand more about the pathways of ageing to plan and cost our health and social care services, to support our ageing population to live healthier for longer and to make adequate provisions for retirement. Longitudinal studies of ageing facilitate such understanding in many countries around the world. Scotland presently does not have a longitudinal study of ageing, despite dramatic increases to its ageing population and its poor health record. Healthy AGeing in Scotland (HAGIS) constitutes the launch of Scotland’s first comprehensive longitudinal study of ageing.
Methods A sample of 1000 people aged 50+ years will be invited to take part in a household social survey. The innovative sampling procedure used administrative data to identify eligible households. Anonymised survey responses will be linked to administrative data.
Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the host institution for the study design and from the Public Benefits and Privacy Panel for administrative data linkage. Anonymised survey data will be deposited with the UK Data Service. A subset of survey data, harmonised with other global ageing studies, will be available via the Gateway to Global Aging platform. These data will enable powerful cross-country comparisons across the social, economic and health domains that will be relevant for national and international research.Research publications from the HAGIS team will be disseminated through journal articles and national and international conferences. The findings will support current and future research and policy debate on ageing populations.},

Scotland will face many policy challenges associated with ageing over the next few decades, including how to meet the increasing demand for health and social care services, how to adapt to an elderly population with increasingly diverse social and economic characteristics and how to provide income support for those outside the labour market.  A necessary condition for effective policy response to these challenges is a clear understanding of the economic, social and health-related conditions faced by older people in Scotland. The UK is a world leading centre for the development longitudinal and cohort studies. These have had a substantial influence on policy development in recent decades. However, Scotland has no longitudinal study that focuses on its ageing population. This report describes the development and results of the pilot survey for such a  longitudinal study.

	abstract = {Objectives
Changes in population structure and underlying health put a significant strain on health care system resources. In this context, projecting future health care needs can contribute to better health care system planning and resource allocation over the long term. This paper presents a model of future demand and costs of care to estimate long-term funding and resource needs up to 2030/31.
Methods
Using data from England, we first calculate health care utilization rates by age, gender and comorbidity, where available, and multiply them by the projected future populations to estimate future demand for a wide range of service areas. We then cost this future demand using 2018/19 unit costs for each service area which we project by accounting for assumptions around future inflation and productivity.
Results
Our results indicate in the longer term, funding for the English NHS would need to increase by around 2.8\% per year in real terms to meet these underlying funding pressures. Further, our projections imply that the number of general and acute care beds would need to grow by between 1.3 and 4.1\% a year and the NHS workforce would need to grow by between 1.8 and 2.6\% a year by 2030/31, depending on productivity assumptions.
Conclusions
Our projections of workforce and hospital beds illustrate the extent of underlying pressures from population ageing and changes in morbidity. Improvements in care emerge as crucial for meeting these pressures.},

These policy options include prevention and health promotion, better self-care, increased coordination of care, improved management of hospital admissions and discharges, improved systems of long-term care, and new work and pension arrangements. Ageing of the health workforce is another challenge, and policies will need to be pursued that meet the particular needs of older workers (ie, those aged 50 years or older) while recruiting young practitioners.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the debate on the ‘red herring’, viz. the claim that population ageing will not have a significant impact on health care expenditure (HCE). It decomposes HCE into seven components, includes both survivors and deceased individuals, and estimates a two-part model of the demand for health care services, using a large Swiss data set for 1999. It finds no or weak age effects on HCE for the components of HCE when proximity to death is controlled for, and points to differences between users and non-users of long-term care (LTC). For deceased non-users of LTC services, a falling age curve for all components of HCE except for inpatient care is observed, while survivors show a weak age effect in ambulatory and inpatient care once proximity to death is controlled for. As to surviving users of LTC services, their probability of incurring LTC expenses markedly increases in old age, while most of the components of their conditional HCE show a decreasing age profile. Thus, a ‘school of red herrings’ can be claimed to exist–with the possible exception of LTC, where ageing might matter regardless of proximity to death. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The econometric analysis of HCE in the last eight quarters of life of individuals who died during the period 1983–1992 indicates that HCE depends on remaining lifetime but not on calendar age, at least beyond 65+. The positive relationship between age and HCE observed in cross-sectional data may be caused by the simple fact that at age 80, for example, there are many more individuals living in their last 2 years than at age 65. The limited impact of age on HCE suggests that population ageing may contribute much less to future growth of the health care sector than claimed by most observers.

This paper used decomposition analysis to assess how changes in these factors affected the number of hospital treatment days from 2000 to 2015 in Germany. Demographic aging was linked to increases in the number of treatment days for women (+10.0\%) and men (+19.2\%) and in hospitalization rates for women +6.0\% and men +5.4\%. However, these increases were offset by decreases in the number of hospital days (women: 16.5\%; men: 7.3\%) and length of stay (women: -27.4\%; men -26.3\%). For the projection up to 2040, 12 scenarios were developed (six for women and six for men) using three variants for future population demographics and two variants for future length of stay and hospitalization rates. One of the two variants for future length of stay and hospitalization rates provides for a constant value for the year 2015. For the second of these two variants variant, a logarithmic model was estimated on the basis of values from 2000 to 2015. and the trends were extrapolated using this model until 2040. The strongest overall predicted increase was 18.4\% between 2015 and 2040, including a 22.4\% increase for men. In two scenarios for women, only slight declines were predicted. All results, both for the decomposition analysis and projection, indicated a moderate but sustained effect of demographic aging on the number of hospital treatment days, leading to a significant increase in hospital treatment days over the study period. Non-demographic factors also had strong influences, especially in shorter time periods, but these effects offset each other over time. The change in the population size in the period under study had very little effect on the number of hospital treatment days.},

The last year of life represents a large proportion (55\%) of lifetime hospital bed occupancy. This is called the nearness to death effect. However, the nearness to death effect has not been factored into NHS capacity planning, which largely relies on age-based forecasting, often called the ageing population.

This model can be modified in 2 ways to accommodate this problem. In the overdispersed model, a factor can be estimated that corrects the regression model's inferential statistics. In the second alternative, the negative binomial regression model, a random term reflecting unexplained between-subject differences is included in the regression model.

	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic Rˆ of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional Rˆ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

	abstract = {Model checking with discrete data regressions can be difficult because the usual methods such as residual plots have complicated reference distributions that depend on the parameters in the model. Posterior predictive checks have been proposed as a Bayesian way to average the results of goodness-of-fit tests in the presence of uncertainty in estimation of the parameters. We try this approach using a variety of discrepancy variables for generalized linear models fitted to a historical data set on behavioural learning. We then discuss the general applicability of our findings in the context of a recent applied example on which we have worked. We find that the following discrepancy variables work well, in the sense of being easy to interpret and sensitive to important model failures: structured displays of the entire data set, general discrepancy variables based on plots of binned or smoothed residuals versus predictors and specific discrepancy variables created on the basis of the particular concerns arising in an application. Plots of binned residuals are especially easy to use because their predictive distributions under the model are sufficiently simple that model checks can often be made implicitly. The following discrepancy variables did not work well: scatterplots of latent residuals defined from an underlying continuous model and quantile–quantile plots of these residuals.},
